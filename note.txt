# setup.sh note

Running this script is like unleashing a pitbull inside your system:  
you don’t fear it... but once it’s loose, it devours every damn process without mercy.

If your shady processes don’t leave on their own, we’ll kick them out hard...  
and if the system freaks out, tough luck.

This isn’t magic, it’s *ProcHunter++*: the silent exterminator.

Run at your own risk, or keep your bugs and cry later.
