**Advanced Process Scanner & Rootkit Detection Tool for Linux**

Credits: [X2X0](https://github.com/X2X0)

## üîç Overview

ProcHunter++ is a sophisticated C++ security tool designed to detect suspicious processes, potential rootkits, and malicious activities on Linux systems. It combines multiple detection techniques to identify anomalous behavior that traditional process monitors might miss.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Detection Capabilities
- **Process Enumeration**: Scans all active processes via `/proc` filesystem
- **Hash Verification**: Calculates SHA256 checksums and compares against trusted whitelist
- **Path Analysis**: Validates executable locations against trusted system paths
- **Memory Inspection**: Detects suspicious memory mappings and code injection
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifies processes matching known malware signatures
- **Hidden Process Detection**: Finds processes with name/cmdline mismatches

### Advanced Features
- **Suspicion Scoring**: Quantitative risk assessment for each process
- **Stealth Mode**: Silent operation until explicitly flagged
- **TUI Interface**: Real-time ncurses-based monitoring (like `htop`)
- **JSON Export**: Machine-readable output for integration with other tools
- **Process Termination**: Automatically kill highly suspicious processes
- **Memory Analysis**: Detect RWX regions, executable heaps, and deleted binaries in memory

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libjsoncpp-dev
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo yum install gcc-c++ openssl-devel ncurses-devel jsoncpp-devel
```

### Build & Install

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/X2X0/ProcHunter-
cd ProcHunter-
make

# Install system-wide
sudo make install

# Or build static version for forensic environments
make static
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive TUI mode (recommended)
sudo prochunter --tui

# Quick scan with JSON output
sudo prochunter --json > scan_results.json

# Silent mode with automatic threat elimination
sudo prochunter --silent --kill --threshold 70

# Export detailed report
sudo prochunter --json | jq '.' > detailed_report.json
```

## üìã Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-t, --tui` | Launch interactive Text User Interface |
| `-s, --silent` | Run in silent mode (no output until completion) |
| `-j, --json` | Export results in JSON format |
| `-k, --kill` | Terminate processes exceeding suspicion threshold |
| `--threshold NUM` | Set suspicion score threshold (default: 50) |
| `-h, --help` | Display help information |

## üéØ Detection Methods

### 1. Signature-Based Detection
- Known malware process names
- Cryptocurrency miner patterns
- Fake kernel thread names
- Suspicious command line arguments

### 2. Behavioral Analysis
- Processes running from temporary directories
- Executables with missing or invalid paths
- Command line / process name mismatches
- Empty command lines for user processes

### 3. Memory Forensics
- RWX (Read-Write-Execute) memory regions
- Executable heap segments
- Deleted executables still running in memory
- Unusual memory mapping patterns

### 4. Hash Verification
- SHA256 checksum validation
- Comparison against trusted binary whitelist
- Detection of modified system binaries

## üìä Suspicion Scoring System

ProcHunter++ assigns suspicion scores based on multiple factors:

| Factor | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Suspicious pattern match | +30 | Process name matches known malware patterns |
| Untrusted location | +15 | Executable located outside trusted system paths |
| Deleted executable | +25 | Binary file deleted but still running in memory |
| Name/cmdline mismatch | +20 | Process name doesn't match command line |
| RWX memory regions | +20 | Writable and executable memory segments |
| Executable heap | +15 | Heap memory marked as executable |
| Empty command line | +15 | No command line arguments for user process |
| Unknown hash | +10 | SHA256 not in trusted whitelist |
| Unreadable executable | +10 | Cannot access process executable path |

**Threat Levels:**
- **0-39**: Low risk (Green)
- **40-69**: Moderate suspicion (Yellow)
- **70+**: High risk (Red) - Recommended for termination

## üñ•Ô∏è Interactive TUI Mode

The Text User Interface provides real-time monitoring with color-coded threat levels:

========================================

PID     Name            Score   Anomalies                    Path
1234    suspicious_proc   85     RWX memory; Deleted exec    /tmp/malware
5678    crypto_miner     75     Pattern match; Untrusted    /dev/shm/miner
9012    normal_process   5      Hash verified               /usr/bin/vim
```

**TUI Controls:**
- `r` - Refresh scan
- `k` - Kill suspicious processes
- `q` - Quit

## üìÅ File Structure

```
prochunter++/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prochunter.cpp      # Main source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                  # Build artifacts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/                    # Compiled binary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ whitelist.txt          # Trusted binary hashes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile               # Build configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## üîß Configuration Files

### Whitelist Management (`whitelist.txt`)
```bash
# Add trusted binary hashes
echo "$(sha256sum /bin/bash | cut -d' ' -f1)" >> whitelist.txt
echo "$(sha256sum /usr/bin/systemd | cut -d' ' -f1)" >> whitelist.txt
```

### Custom Suspicious Patterns
Edit the `initializeSuspiciousPatterns()` function to add custom detection rules:

```cpp
suspicious_patterns.push_back("your_malware_pattern");
suspicious_patterns.push_back("custom_threat_name");
```

## üö® Use Cases

### 1. Incident Response
```bash
# Quick forensic scan
sudo prochunter --silent --json > incident_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json

# Real-time monitoring during investigation
sudo prochunter --tui
```

### 2. System Hardening
```bash
# Regular security checks
sudo prochunter --threshold 40 --kill
```

### 3. Malware Analysis
```bash
# Detailed analysis with memory inspection
sudo prochunter --json | jq '.processes[] | select(.suspicion_score > 50)'
```

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Cron job for automated scanning
0 */6 * * * /usr/local/bin/prochunter --silent --json >> /var/log/prochunter.log
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Permissions
- **Root access required** for full functionality
- Memory analysis requires elevated privileges
- Process termination needs administrative rights

### False Positives
- Legitimate software in unusual locations may trigger alerts
- Custom compiled applications might not be in whitelist
- Review results before using `--kill` option

### Evasion Resistance
- Multiple detection vectors make evasion difficult
- Memory analysis catches fileless malware
- Hash verification prevents binary modification
